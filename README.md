This repository contains renewed Java code implementing various machine learning algorithms which include:

* Swift and simple **k-nearest neighbor** algorithm.

* Utilization of **k-means** algorithm accompanied by MDL for model selection.

* Features an implementation of **neural-nets**.

* Emphasizes a **Gibbs sampling** algorithm to detect motifs in sequences.

* Incorporates a **Genetic Algorithm** that solves the 8 queens problem. 

* Greedy **agglomerative clustering** coupled with basic graphing.

* Execution of an experiment involving **evolutionary neural-nets**.

* Update on **Ensemble Selection** method (shotgun).

This code is brought to you by MiniMarz, providing a fresh take on previously implemented ML algorithms, with an aim to provide a starting
